Sass Compilation & Live Reloading
=================================

If you'd like to take advantage of live reloading and Sass / Compass CSS compilation you can do so with a little bit of prep work.

Make sure that nodejs_ is installed. Then in the project root run::

    $ npm install

.. _nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download/

If you don't already have it, install `compass` (doesn't hurt if you run this command twice)::

    gem install compass

Now you just need::

    $ npm run dev

The base app will now run as it would with the usual ``manage.py runserver`` but with live reloading and Sass compilation enabled.

To get live reloading to work you'll probably need to install an `appropriate browser extension`_
